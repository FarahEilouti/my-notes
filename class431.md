#### Component-based architecture is a software design approach in which a system is composed of interchangeable components that can be independently developed, tested, and deployed. These components are self-contained units of functionality that can be plugged into a larger system to provide specific functionality.

#### A component-level design can be represented by using some intermediary representation (e.g. graphical, tabular, or text-based) that can be translated into source code. The design of data structures, interfaces, and algorithms should conform to well-established guidelines to help us avoid the introduction of errors.

#### There are several benefits to using a component-based architecture, including:

* Improved maintainability

* Increased flexibility

* Enhanced reusability

* Better scalability
