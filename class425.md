## _Django REST Framework & Docker_
#
####  Docker is an open-source tool that manages the development, testing and deployment of containerized applications.

#### It offers hardware virtualization at the OS level and is suitable for modern architecture. This allows developers to package and ship software and its dependencies in order to distribute it as containers.

#### Docker allows to support several containers with one infrastructure rather than using multiple virtual machines to run identical copies of the virtual OS managed by the hypervisor, which can be expensive to maintain.


#### Django REST framework (DRF) is a open source, mature and well supported Python/Django library that aims at building sophisticated web APIs. It is flexible and fully-featured toolkit with modular and customizable architecture that makes possible development of both simple, turn-key API endpoints and complicated REST constructs.

#### Django REST framework contains wide set of out of the box features, but the core view class is very simple and framework in general is easy to use. The main idea behind the DRF is to clearly divide a model, the generalized wire representation (e.g. JSON, XML, etc.), and set of generic Class-Based-Views that can be customized to satisfy the specific API endpoint using Serializer that describes the mapping between them.

#### main advantages of Django REST framework:
- Simplicity, flexibility, quality, and test coverage of source code.
- Powerful serialization engine compatible with both ORM and non-ORM data sources.
- Generic classes for CRUD operations.
- Clean, simple, views for Resources, using Django's new class based views.
- Support for ModelResources with out-of-the-box default implementations and input validation (optional support for forms as input validation).
- HTTP response handling, content type negotiation using HTTP Accept headers.
