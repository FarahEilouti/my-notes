##  _Data Analysis_
# 
#### Data Analysis is the process of systematically applying statistical and/or logical techniques to describe and illustrate, condense and recap, and evaluate data.

#### We can use the **Jupyter notebook** to run pieces of code with the format file of ipynb (interactive python notebook)

#### rather than writing an re-writing a whole program; Jupyter alows interpreting lines of code and run them one at a time
#
#### **numPy** is a python library and a package mostly used and employed when dealing with mathematical operations and statistical methods.
