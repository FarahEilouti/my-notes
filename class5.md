##  _Intro to OOP_
# 
#### OOP is short for Object-Oriented Programming, which depends on objects and classes to organize instances. 

#### OOP is a bit more complex than structural programmimg, but it's more secure, flexible, reusable and supports abstraction and inheritance.

#### Main principals of OOP are: 
* Encapsulation 
* Abstraction
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
#
#### Encapsulation: which is the mechanism that binds together the code + data and keeps them safe from interference and mis-use, it's in general good for protection of data.
#
#### Abstraction: the process of hiding implementation details from the user, which means that only functionlities will be visible to users not how they were made or came from. A method defined abstract must always be redefined in the subclass.
#
#### Inheritance: the process in which one object **aquires** the properties of another object. The class from which the subclass is derived is called super class, or parent class... meanwhile the class that is derived from another class is called a subclass or child class. 
#
#### Polymorphism: another word for 'many forms', which is the ability to request that the same methods be performed by wide range of different types of things.
