#### The **Big O Notation** can be summarized from the audio we heard is that a way of calculating the complexity an a certain algorithm and the time needed to execute. Which in other words means talking about how long an algorithm takes to run (time complexity) or how much memory is used by an algorithm (space complexity). It's benefit that it allows us to know the worst, ideal or normal consumption of time and space to an algorithm in-use. 
#
#### Python language is dynamically-typed and doesn't need to declare the data types of variables, in addition to that variables are case sensitive to spaces and cannot be started with an underscore,a digit nor a reserved word by Python.

#
#### A virtual environment is a Python environment such that the Python interpreter, libraries and scripts installed into it are isolated from those installed in other virtual environments, users can make a virtual environment active by running an activate script in the virtual environment’s executables directory. Once a virtual environment has been created, it can be “activated” using a script in the virtual environment’s binary directory.
