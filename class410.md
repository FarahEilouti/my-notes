## _Linear Regression_
#
#### Linear regression performs the task to predict a dependent variable value (y) based on a given independent variable (x). So, this regression technique finds out a linear relationship between x (input) and y(output).
#
#### The relationship between two variables based on a line of best fit is the representation of LInear regression.
#
#### Linear regression is commonly used for predictive analysis and modeling. For example, it can be used to quantify the relative impacts of age, gender, and diet (the predictor variables) on height (the outcome variable).
#
#### Linear Reg is the next step after correlation. It is used when we want to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. The variable we want to predict is called the dependent variable (or sometimes, the outcome variable).
