## _Authentication_
#
#### Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or client. In a React application, authentication is typically implemented using a combination of server-side and client-side techniques.

#### On the server side, authentication is typically implemented using some kind of authentication service or middleware, such as Passport.js. This service is responsible for verifying the identity of the user, and for generating and storing authentication tokens that can be used to verify the user's identity on subsequent requests.

#### On the client side, authentication is typically implemented using a library or framework that is designed to handle authentication flows and manage authentication state. For example, you might use the react-auth-hook library, which provides a set of hooks for handling authentication flows and storing and retrieving authentication tokens.
