#### In React, a "hook" is a function that allows you to "hook into" the state and lifecycle features of a React component from a function component. Custom hooks are simply functions that can encapsulate logic that can be reused across multiple components.

#### "lifting state up" refers to the process of moving shared state from a lower-level component to a higher-level component that is shared between multiple components. This can be useful when you have two or more components that need to share the same state, but the state is not being managed by a common ancestor component.

#### "memoization" refers to the process of caching the results of a function and returning the cached result when the function is called with the same arguments. This can be useful for optimizing the performance of a React application, particularly when the function being memoized is called frequently or when it is computationally expensive. One common use case for memoization in React is to optimize the performance of pure components, which are components that only re-render when their props have changed.
