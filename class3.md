# Class 3
##  _Whiteboarding + Big O_
# 
#### First of all, the Big O notation describes the complexity of a code using algebraic terms. 
##
#### in other words means talking about how long an algorithm takes to run (time complexity) or how much memory is used by an algorithm (space complexity). It's benefit that it allows us to know the worst, ideal or normal consumption of time and space to an algorithm in-use. 
#### there are constant times where a certain algorithm has the least complexity and ideal properties, What also matters is the space the program takes to complete the task. The space complexity is related to how much memory the program will use
#
#### White boarding is a technique used in technical interviews to make a candidate write pieces of code by hand to watch the logic flow and syntax awareness (deatils). it can be also good to write skeches and plans for a to-be-written code, which in other words can be used for pseducodes.
