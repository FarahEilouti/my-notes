## _Trees_
#
#### A tree is a type of data structure representing hierarchical data. It has a **non-linear** structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. Among the other types of data structures that perform operations in a linear data structure

#### Each Tree consists of a root node from which we can access each element of the tree, in python when we want to insert into a tree we use the same node class created above and add a insert class to it. The insert class compares the value of the node to the parent node and decides to add it as a left node or a right node. Finally the PrintTree class is used to print the tree.
