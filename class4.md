##  _FileIO & Exceptions_
# 
#### First of all we are goin to talk about dealing with files in Python, The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists. That is, the file is in the append mode. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for writing. Python has a built-in open() function to open a file. The function to close a file in Python is simply fileobject.close().

# Exceptions
#### It's used in the code to make special properties of a statement or condition to have a unique case of result, This type of error occurs whenever syntactically correct Python code results in an error. The last line of the message indicated what type of exception error you ran into.

#### For example, if we have an error; instead of showing the message exception error, Python details what type of exception error was encountered. In this case, python comes with various built-in exceptions as well as the possibility to create self-defined exceptions.
