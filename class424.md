#### A Hash Table in Python is nothing but a data structure where data is stored in an associative manner. In hash tables, data is stored in an array format, with every data value having an exclusive or unique index value. This type of storage offers quick access to data if the index of the data required is available.

#### Thus, the data structure provides easy and quick search and insertion irrespective of the data size. A Hash Table in Python utilizes an array as a medium of storage and uses the hash method to create an index where an element is to be searched from or needs to be inserted.

#### In other words, a Hash Table in Python is a data structure which stores data by using a pair of values and keys. Each data value is allocated an exclusive key that is created by using the hash functions. Then, to access its associated value the name of the key is used, thus making searching of data values a very fast and efficient process.
