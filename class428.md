## _Authentication & Production Server_
#
#### In general, authentication servers and production servers are used to perform different functions in a computer system. Authentication servers are responsible for verifying the identity of users, while production servers are responsible for hosting and running applications or websites in a live environment.

#### JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are a standard for representing claims securely between two parties. They are often used to authenticate users and authorize access to protected resources.
