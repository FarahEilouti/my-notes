## _Stack and Queue_
#
#### The stack is an abstract data type that holds an ordered, linear sequence of items. In contrast to a queue, a stack is a last in, first out (LIFO) structure. A real-life example is a stack of plates: you can only take a plate from the top of the stack, and you can only add a plate to the top of the stack.
#
#### The queue is defined as a linear data structure that stores the elements sequentially in First In First Out (FIFO) order. We define a queue to be a list in which all additions to the list are made at one end, and all deletions from the list are made at the other end.
### it has four types:
* Simple queue
* Circular Queue.
* Priority Queue.
* Double Ended Queue.

#### Queues are typically used to manage threads in multithreading and implementing priority queuing systems.
