## _Linked list_
#
#### Linked Lists are a data structure that store data in the form of a chain. The structure of a linked list is such that each piece of data has a connection to the next one (and sometimes the previous data as well). Each element in a linked list is called a node.

#### The main advantage of using a linked list over arrays is that it is possible to implement a stack that can shrink or grow as much as needed.

#### There are four types of linked lists, which are:
* Singly linked lists.
* Doubly linked lists.
* Circular linked lists.
* Circular doubly linked lists.

#### Linked lists are often used because of their **efficient insertion and deletion**. They can be used to implement stacks, queues, and other abstract data types.
