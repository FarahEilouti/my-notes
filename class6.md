#### The **design patterns** are strategies being follwed to create an ideal code or solve a problem. There are types of design patterns, which are: 
* creational, which how objects get created
* structural, how classes and objects be structured
* behavioural, how objects interact with each other.
#
#### The **risk analysis** in software testing is mainly to identify the possible problems to occur during development and implementation process, in addition to having a detailed to-do plan when a program fails after a launch/release. This is useful for preventing future mistakes and consequences.

**** 
#### **Dependency injection**  is a design pattern in which an object or function receives other objects or functions that it depends on. A form of inversion of control, dependency injection aims to separate the concerns of constructing objects and using them, leading to loosely coupled programs.
