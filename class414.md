## _Web scraping_
#
#### Web scraping is the process of using bots to extract content and data from a website.

#### Web scraping is an important skill for any data scientist to have in their toolbox. Web scraping can be used to collect data about products for sale, user posts, images, and pretty much anything else that is useful on the web.

#### Web scraping is legal if you scrape data publicly available on the internet. But some kinds of data are protected by international regulations, so be careful scraping personal data, intellectual property, or confidential data. Respect your target websites and use empathy to create ethical scrapers.
