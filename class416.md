#### Cryptography is a way to hide and turn different types of data into an unreadable or understandable state, this can by happens by shifting letters into a specific number of digits (stored in a key) to decrypt the encrypted (shifted) letters and read the hidden data. 

#### Today, cryptography is used to keep sensitive material, such as private passwords, secure online. Cybersecurity experts use cryptography to design algorithms, ciphers, and other security measures that codify and protect company and customer data.

#### Cryptography can ensure the confidentiality and integrity of both data in transit as well as data at rest. It can also authenticate senders and recipients to one another and protect against repudiation. Software systems often have multiple endpoints, typically multiple clients, and one or more back-end servers
