## _Data Visualization_
#
#### Data visualization is to present data after processing or manipulation, into a final readable-form to users, in which it will be informative and summarized to the status of data using different charts or templates.
#
#### In python there are libraries which can be deployed to help making visualization to datasets after being processed, such as **matplotlib** and **seaborn** 
#
#### ***Matplotlib*** is an amazing visualization library in Python for 2D plots of arrays, It is a multi-platform data visualization library built on NumPy arrays and designed to work with the broader SciPy stack. it has features like:
* Itâ€™s fast, efficient as it is based on numpy and also easier to build
* Well maintained visualization output with high quality graphics draws a lot of users to it
#
#### ***Seaborn*** library sits on top of matplotlib. In a sense, it has some flavors of matplotlib while from the visualization point, it is much better than matplotlib and has added features as well. Below are its advantages:

* Built-in themes aid better visualization
* Statistical functions aiding better data insights
* Better aesthetics and built-in plots
* Helpful documentation with effective examples
